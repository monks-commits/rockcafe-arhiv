<b>Slade - History</b>
<p> The band started out as the N'Betweens in 1966, formed from members of two 
  Midlands bands, The Vendors and Steve Brett &amp; The Mavericks. They initially 
  had little success, and in the late 1960s the band changed its name to Ambrose 
  Slade and hooked up with manager Chas Chandler. Their name was eventually shortened 
  to Slade, and the band adopted a skinhead look, as an attempt to gain publicity 
  from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend. They later abandoned this look, 
  due to the unwelcome association with football hooliganism. They grew their 
  hair long again, in time to become a leading part of the glam rock movement, 
  releasing songs with deliberately Black Country-style mis-spelled titles which 
  made them stand out.
<p>From 1971 to 1975, the band scored many huge-selling consecutive hit albums 
  and singles. Singles entered the charts at number one - a feat unheard of since 
  the days of The Beatles. Their concerts were all automatic sellouts, and the 
  band was the first to take the risk of booking the massive Earls Court Exhibition 
  Centre in London for a couple of nights (although David Bowie promptly booked 
  the venue for a couple of dates before Slade were due to perform). Following 
  this period, Don Powell was critically injured in a car crash and the band's 
  future was left in the balance. Powell eventually recovered, although he still 
  suffers with acute short-term memory and sensory problems.</p>
<p>Slade starred in the rock movie Flame in 1974. Film critic Mark Kermode believed 
  it to be the best rock biopic of all time. The soundtrack album included the 
  top 5 hit Far far away and the top 20 hit How does it feel. The movie was a 
  dark gritty work about the seedier side of the music business, and was not what 
  many critics and fans were expecting. It reinforced the inaccurate idea that 
  Slade suffered from internal disputes, cost them some fans.</p>
<p>After touring in the United States for a year, Slade became overshadowed in 
  the UK by the advent of new pop teen idols and the development of Punk rock 
  in the late 1970s. Without radio play, Slade's hits largely dried up. They moved 
  from the major Polydor label to their manager's own label, Barn Records; and 
  then to their independent Cheapskate label. They carried on playing concerts 
  at bigger clubs and Universities, while waiting for chart success to come round 
  again. The music press either grudgingly acknowledged the power of their live 
  shows, or simply ignored them - mainly the latter.</p>
<p>Due to changes in music trends and the advent of punk rock and New Wave music, 
  Slade's success faded somewhat by the late 1970s, although the group continued 
  to release records. They enjoyed a return to the UK charts in the early 1980s, 
  and managing to enter the charts in the United States.</p>
<p>In August 1980, Ozzy Osbourne's Blizzard Of Ozz cancelled their set at the 
  Reading Festival with very short notice. Slade, who had all but disbanded, were 
  recommended to replace them. A demoralised Dave Hill had effectively left the 
  band and initially refused to do the show when asked by the other band members, 
  but their manager, Chas Chandler convinced Hill to play what could very well 
  have been their last ever live show in front of a huge crowd rather than in 
  a small club. To Hill's utter astonishment, the band were well-received at the 
  festival, and quickly became darlings of the music press again — despite doing 
  nothing different at Reading than they had done onstage in recent years.</p>
<p>A new run of chart success followed, though not on the large scale of their 
  1970s heights. Holder and Lea became in-demand for production and songwriting 
  duties for other acts for a while. Slade had another two UK top 10 hits in 1984, 
  with the singles Run Runaway and My Oh My (#2 UK, #36 US). Run Runaway reached 
  #7, which would be their second top 40 hit in the USA — and their first since 
  Gudbuy T'Jane, which barely made the top 40 in 1972. Interestingly enough, these 
  hits happened despite Slade not touring to support the releases.</p>
<p>They later returned to the UK singles chart in 1991 with the song Radio Wall 
  of Sound.</p>
<p>Noddy Holder became weary of constant touring, effectively managing the band 
  and of the music business and left the band in late 1991 after 25 years. The 
  remainder of the band were given a period of notice in which to consider their 
  options. Rather than take on another singer, Jimmy Lea effectively retired. 
  Dave Hill and Don Powell (the band's founder members) formed Slade II with three 
  other local musicians at that point. The name was once again shortedned to Slade 
  after a period.</p>
