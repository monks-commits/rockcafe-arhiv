  Ljubchenko. There are European classic tradition, Indian classic music, flamenco, 
  Slav native music (Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia), jazz, blues, 
  rock, intonations of East. A great influence to Alexander as a guitarist have

  as the one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the country. He played with many 
  famous rock and jazz bands in 70’s. He performed as accompanist for chamber 
  and pop singers. </p>
<p>Since 1976 he prefers untraditional styles of music. He works a lot as a composer 
  («Guitar Almanac #1 — 1986»), «Musical Ukraine», «Musical life», 3 encyclopedias: 
  «Anthology of Soviet Jazz», «Encyclopedia of young musician», «Jazz in USSR»,

  and colors, the blues have been replaced with a Russian native romance. «BNW» 
  takes part at the jazz festivals of Russia, Lithuania, having a great success 
  at the audience owing to the beauty of music and virtuosity of performers. </p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1991 «BNW» become a sensation having perform at the International 
  Moscow radio festival (its former was a famous musical critic and art-critic 
  Dmitry Ukhov). «BNW» have been enthusiasts and initiators of forming the festival 
  dedicated to Jaco Pastorius in Naberezhnye Chelny (ãðóäåíü1991 ð.). Television 
  records the performance of «BNW» and broadcast it all over Ukraine. </p>
<p>In September — October of 1993 Alexander plays a set of concerts with a bass 
  player Michael Krymov (the former bass player of «Credo») in Lintz, Austria. 
  Republic television records the live concert of the duet and broadcast it in 
  the TV-program «A Guitar Academy» (the only serious program dedicated to the 
  guitar). At least for 20 times Alexander came up in this program for the period 
  of 1992 — 1995 years. Dmitry Ukhov in his radio program «Jazz alarm-clock» (radio 
  Mayak, Moscow) applied and referenced to the music and playing manner of Alexander

  Playing in the festivals. Forming of the project «Super-Trio» — Alexander Ljubchenko

  Acting in a duet with Michael Krymov. Playing in a duet with Sergey Makarov. 
</p>
<p>October of 1997 — sensational performance in duet with Michael Krymov in the 
  «Inter-Guitar’97» festival, Kiev. Recordings on the television. </p>
<p>1998 — 1999 — concert performing and teaching acting. </p>
<p>2000 — common touring with a jazz guitar star Alexey Kuznetsov (Moscow). Acting

<p>2001 — performing in trio — Alexander Ljubchenko — guitar; Igor’ Ljubchenko

  jazz-festival in Dnepropetrovsk. </p>
<p>2002 — acting in Spain. Cooperation with Karlos Benavent (the former guitarist

  festivals. Duet activity with Yury Piven’. An albums «Tonka Gorobyna» and «Vojin 
  vich’nosti». </p>
<p>October of 2004 — the concert of Alexander Ljubchenko Trio — Alexander Ljubchenko 
  — guitar; Vitaly Hrenov — drums; Jury Piven’ — electro-bass in the line-up of 
  the festival «European jazz on the Dnepr».</p>
<p>It was an absolutely fantastic performance played by trio leaded by Alexander 
  Ljubchenko, the one of the greatest European guitar players. A synthesized sound 
  seemed to rip off the air, explosive passages and licks, subtlety rhythmical 
  patterns, maximal giving the instrument’s sound closer ties with man voice intonations. 
  Especially the audience felt it when Alexander start to sing up in unison with 
  a guitar (composition «Klyuch» (’A key’), showing an excellent technique inherent 
  in Balkan melos. Just outstanding action. What a charisma! Those who attended 
  the concerts of John MacClauhlin’s or Paco De Lucia will get what it all about. 
  High jazz level have been showed by a drummer Vitaly Hrenov from Moscow. Many 
  from the audience would be amazed if only would know that the musicians haven’t 
  rehearsed much together (just sound-check tuning). Yuri Piven’ left a pleasant 
  impression too, the bright and aggressive manner of playing distinguish him. 
  The result was an natural jazz-rock, the one that I haven’t heard from a festival 
  scene for a long time. </p>
<p>D. Mushkin, «Dnepr Vecherniy» newspaper #169 (11034), 06.11.2004</p>
<p>On the 16-th of October 2005 he was awarded by the State Duma of Russia for 
  the development of the culture values of Russia.</p>
