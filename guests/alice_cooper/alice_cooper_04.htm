<p> <b>Alice Cooper - History</b> 
<p> Vincent Furnier was born in Detroit, Michigan to Ether Moroni Furnier and 
  Ella Mae McCart. After a series of childhood illnesses, he moved to Phoenix, 
  Arizona. His grandfather, Thurman Sylvester Furnier, was an ordained Apostle 
  of the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite). Vincent's father was an ordained 
  Elder. Vincent has some distant French Huguenot ancestry; the remainder of his 
  ancestry was English and Scottish.[1]
<p>Cooper was influenced by British bands such as The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The 
  Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and in particular The Yardbirds. As a result, 
  he formed a number of rock bands in the 1960s, including The Earwigs, The Spiders, 
  and The Nazz. Upon learning that Todd Rundgren also had a band called The Nazz, 
  Furnier changed the band's name to &quot;Alice Cooper.&quot; Early press releases 
  claimed that the name was agreed upon after one of Furnier's Ouija sessions, 
  and learning that he was a reincarnation of a 17th century &quot;witch&quot; 
  of the same name. However, Cooper in later interviews has said the name actually 
  came out of thin air conjuring an image of &quot;a cute little girl with an 
  axe behind her back.&quot;</p>
<p>The classic Alice Cooper group line up consisted of Cooper, guitarists Michael 
  Bruce and Glen Buxton, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith. All of 
  the band members except Neal were on the Cortez High School cross country track 
  team. The original drummer was Jim Spears, who was the team equipment manager. 
  Many of Alice's &quot;effects&quot; were inspired by the track coach, Emmit 
  Smith, who also was the journalism teacher. One of Smith's class project was 
  to build a working guillotine for slicing watermelons.</p>
<p><strong>1970s</strong></p>
<p>In 1970, after the band had recorded two records on Straight Records, the band, 
  under the Warner Brothers label, teamed up with fledgling producer Bob Ezrin 
  on their album entitled Love It to Death. This was the first of more than ten 
  Alice Cooper group and solo albums done with Ezrin who is credited with having 
  helped to create their definitive sound. A hit single soon followed in 1971's 
  &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot;. The band's trailblazing mix of shock and glam theatrics 
  stood out amongst bearded, denim-clad hippy bands by sporting sequined costumes 
  by the prominent rock fashion designer Cindy Dunaway (Pink Floyd, The Who), 
  and stage shows that involved Gothic torture modes imposed on the lead singer. 
  Cooper's outspoken views on the Vietnam War stood out no less, as Cooper was 
  always staunchly pro-war—in stark contrast to the vast majority of musicians 
  at the time, who were rebelliously anti-war. [citation needed]</p>
<p>The follow up album Killer included further singles in &quot;Under My Wheels&quot;, 
  &quot;Be My Lover&quot;, and &quot;Halo Of Flies&quot;, which was a Top 10 hit 
  in Holland. In the summer of 1972, Alice Cooper released the appropriately-titled 
  School's Out. The album reached #2 on the charts and sold over a million copies. 
  The title song went Top 10 in the US, was a #1 single in the UK, and remains 
  a staple on classic rock radio.</p>
<p><strong>1980s</strong></p>
<p>His albums from the beginning of 1980s, Flush the Fashion, Special Forces, 
  Zipper Catches Skin, and DaDa, were not commercially successful, especially 
  in comparison to previous sales. They were regarded as very strange and bizarre 
  at that time. However, they are now considered cult classics. Flush the Fashion 
  has a spare, edgy musical sound that was so unexpected as to have been truly 
  baffling to long-time fans, but yielded a mild hit with &quot;Clones (We're 
  All)&quot;. The other three albums continued with the experimental &quot;New 
  Wave&quot; sound.</p>
<p><strong>1990s</strong></p>
<p>In 1991, the album Hey Stoopid was released. He also appeared on the Guns N' 
  Roses album Use Your Illusion I, singing backup on the track &quot;The Garden&quot;. 
  He also made a brief appearance as the abusive stepfather of Freddy Krueger 
  in the Nightmare On Elm Street film Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991).</p>
<p>In 1992, Cooper made a famous cameo in the movie Wayne's World, in which he 
  discusses the history of Milwaukee in some depth. The movie's main characters 
  Wayne and Garth held Cooper in extremely high regard, chanting &quot;We're not 
  worthy!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2000s</strong></p>
<p>A pause, lasting for six years, ended in 2000 with Brutal Planet. Brutal Planet 
  is musically strong, dark and loud, with subject matter thematically inspired 
  by the brutality of the modern world, although set in a post-apocalyptic future. 
  It was succeeded by Dragontown in 2001, which has been described by Cooper as 
  being &quot;the worst town on Brutal Planet&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2003, Cooper again adopted a leaner, cleaner sound for The Eyes Of Alice 
  Cooper. Recognizing that many current bands were having great success with his 
  former sounds and styles, Cooper worked with a somewhat younger group of road 
  and studio musicians who were very familiar with his oeuvre. However, instead 
  of rehashing the old sounds, they updated them, often with surprisingly effective 
  results. The resulting Bare Bones tour adopted a less-orchestrated performance 
  style that had fewer theatrical flourishes and a greater emphasis on musicality. 
  The success of this tour helped support the growing recognition that the classic 
  Cooper songs were exceptionally clever, tuneful, and unique.</p>
<p>On August 26 to 28 2006, Cooper took part in an annual celebrity golf version 
  of the Ryder Cup called The All*Star Cup in South Wales, UK. August 26 was practice 
  day, August 27 and 28 were the two days of competition. Europe won the Cup for 
  the 2nd year running. Cooper won his match on the first day, and lost his match 
  on day two. Meat Loaf was a fellow member of the US team. The event was a big 
  success, with large crowds attending, and the two main days of competition were 
  shown live on UK television. The commentators made many references to Cooper 
  being the best player and that he played six days a week back home in Arizona. 
  Cooper clearly enjoyed the event and hopefully will return to play again in 
  future years of The All*Star Cup.</p>
